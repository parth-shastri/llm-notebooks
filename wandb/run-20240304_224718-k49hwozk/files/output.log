<|im_start|>assistant
Bengay for muscle relief contains methyl salicylate, menthol, and aspirin, which is an active ingredient commonly found in aspirin. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is used to relieve muscle and joint pain, inflammation, and fever. Methyl salicylate is a natural oil found in plants, and menthol is a compound found in mint plants which is commonly used in cosmetics and aromatherapy. Both ingredients work together to provide muscle relief and reduce pain.<|im_end|>

You can't get rid of llamas in your backyard because they are wild animals and are protected by law. Attempting to capture or remove them without permission is illegal and could result in fines or other punishments. The best course of action is to contact your local animal control office or wildlife conservation organization for advice on how to safely and humanely deal with llamas in your backyard.<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
To build a fence around a rectangular garden, you will need 70 feet of fencing. To find this answer, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2l + 2w. So, P = 2(25) + 2(15) = 70. Therefore, you need 70 feet of fencing to enclose the garden.<|im_end|>

There are several methods you can use to get rid of llamas in your backyard, including using humane traps and relocating them to a new area. You can also try to use deterrents such as noise-making devices or unpleasant smells to discourage them from entering your property. If these methods fail, you may need to contact a professional wildlife removal service to help get rid of the llamas.<|im_end|>
